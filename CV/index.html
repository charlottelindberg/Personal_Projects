            Hello, my name is Charlotte, and this is my version of a Curriculum Vitae.
            <br>
            I am 39 years old, originate from Sweden, and I believe that I am the candidate that you seek. As
            you continue to read further and learn more about myself, I hope that I will be able to convince you of
            the same.

            In May 2018 my time at Sony Europe Ltd. came to an end, when the head offices in Tokyo, Japan decided to
            do a worldwide restructuring. In the time that followed I took my time to contemplate if the path I was
            on
            was the right one for me, and re-discovered my passion for designing and creating websites. Following
            this
            new insight, I enrolled in an intensive Web Developer course. Here I have learned to master HTML, CSS
            and
            JavaScript (among others). Although setting on this path at a late point in life, I feel that combining my
            new
            skill-set with my
            previous experiences in copywriting and photography fully completes me as an online content creator.

                <h4>I am extremely versatile, and easily adapt to new situations.</h4>
                When I was 15 I decided I wanted to study photography. The closest school was a long drive from home, so
                I moved and lived on my own for the following three years. When I was 19 I decided I wanted to further
                study photography, and moved to Australia. Then it so happened I fell in love with some guy from
                Belgium, so when I was 26 I moved here. In 2014 we had our fairytale wedding :).

                <h4>I am empathetic to othersâ€™ needs and have excellent listening skills.</h4>
                This is what makes me a great online writer. I actively listen to what is being said, and ask the
                necessary follow-up questions to be able to produce the best possible content. My secret is to use a
                language that even my tech-deprived parents would be able to understand, and they are the type of people
                that uses both hands to move a mouse cursor.
